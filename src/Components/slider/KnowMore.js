        <h2>Shri Swami Sivananda Saraswati</h2>
        <p>
          Swami Sivananda Saraswati (8 September 1887 â€“ 14 July 1963), also called Swami Sivananda, was a yoga guru, a Hindu spiritual teacher, and a proponent of Vedanta. He was born in Pattamadai, in the Tirunelveli district of modern Tamil Nadu, and studied medicine, serving as a physician before becoming a monk.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was the founder of the Divine Life Society (DLS) in 1936, Yoga-Vedanta Forest Academy (1948), and author of over 200 books. Sivananda established the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh, where he lived most of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          His teachings promoted the "Yoga of Synthesis," which combines the Four Yogas of Hinduism: Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Raja Yoga, focusing on action, devotion, knowledge, and meditation respectively. His work made yoga accessible to the general public worldwide.
